    /// <remarks>
    ///     <c>volatile</c> guarantees memory-visibility and prevents reordering, but does
    ///     not guarantee atomicity of read-modify-write sequences.  Because this property
    ///     only ever performs simple, independent assignments (set a new level; no
    ///     conditional update based on the current value), the current implementation is
    ///     safe under concurrent access.  If conditional update semantics are added in
    ///     the future, migrate the backing field to <see cref="System.Threading.Interlocked" />
    ///     operations to preserve correctness.
